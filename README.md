# APC_64_40_11

Remote script for the Akai APC40 with Ableton Live 11 based on APC_40_9 Remote script. Bumped the remote script version to Ableton Live 11 by converting the whole codestack from Python 2 to 3.

Below  you can find the original README with some minor changes regarding versioning of Ableton.

Installation
------------
To install the script, just download this repository and move the entire “APC_64_40_11″ containing folder to the Ableton Remote Scripts directory. On Windows, it should be at:
"MIDI Remote Scripts\”.

On Mac OS X, find the Ableton application file and right click -> “Show Package Contents”. You’ll find the Remote Script folder in
“Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts”.

Once the script is in place, launch Live and open the preferences window. In the “MIDI / Sync” tab, you’ll find a listing of your connected MIDI gear. Find your APC40, and in the left column, change the default selection to “APC_64_40_11”. Hold the shift button and press the various Track Selection buttons to switch modes. If the clip grid changes to show new layouts, it’s installed correctly.
